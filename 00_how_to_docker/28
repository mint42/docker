# 28. ... Damn it, a group or zergs is attacking orbital-command, and shutting
# down the engineering-bay service won't help at all... You must send a troupe
# of Marines to eliminate the intruders. Launch a 42school/marine-squad in two
# replicas, and make sure that the service works properly (see the
# documentation provided at hub.docker.com). This service will be named...
# marines and will be on the overmind network.

docker service create --replicas 2 --name marines --network overmind --env OC_USERNAME=bingo --env OC_PASSWD=bongo 42school/marine-squad
