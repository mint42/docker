28. ... Damn it, a group or zergs is attacking orbital-command, and shutting down the engineering-bay service won't help at all... You must send a troupe of Marines to eliminate the intruders. Launch a 42school/marine-squad in two repliceas, and make sure that the service works properly (see the documentation provided at hub.docker.com). This service will be named... marines and will be on the overmind network.
