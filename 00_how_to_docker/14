# 14. Launch a wordpress container as a background task, just for fun. The
# container should be named lair, its 80 port should be bound to the 8080 port
# of the virtual machine, and it should be able to use the spawning-pool
# container as a database service. You can try to access lair on your machine
# via a web browser, with the IP address of the virtual machine as a URL.
# Congratulations, you just deployed a functional Wordpress website in two
# commands!
#

docker run --detach --name lair --link spawning-pool --publish 8080:80 --env WORDPRESS_DB_NAME=zerglings --env WORDPRESS_DB_PASSWORD=Kerrigan --env WORDPRESS_DB_HOST=spawning-pool:3306 --env WORDPRESS_DB_USER=root wordpress
