# 12. Launch a mysql container as a background task. It should be able to
# restart on its own in case of error, and the root password of the database
# should be Kerrigan. You will also make sure that the database is stored in
# the hatchery volume, that the container directly creates a database named
# zerglings, and that the container itself is named spawning-pool.

docker run --detach --restart on-failure --env MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=Kerrigan --volume hatchery:/var/lib/mysql --env MYSQL_DATABASE=zerglings --name spawning-pool mysql --default-authentication-plugin=mysql_native_password
